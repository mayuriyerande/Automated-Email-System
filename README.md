# Automated-Email-System
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Sending Emails to a group privately with their personal information is a very hectic task. Our Automated Email System is used to send emails to all the students at a time automatically sorting them into defaulters and not defaulters with the attachments if required based on their average attendance. It would be helpful if the system is smart enough to sort the data and sends emails respectively to each student. Our System makes this task easier for the user.
